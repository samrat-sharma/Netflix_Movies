# Netflix_Movies
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Netflix movie trends, visualizing key insights on genre
popularity (with top 3 genres showing a 25% share), release year distribution (showing a 10-year trend of 100+
movies), and regional content availability (identifying 5 regions with the highest content gaps).

Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy, using Power BIâ€™s DAX functions and advanced
visualization techniques to provide actionable insights on content trends and availability.
